 <h2>About Me</h2>

  <img src ="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAniAAAAJGRlZTU0ODVmLTU2ZmEtNDQ4ZS1hMzNhLTY3ZTdlMjRlZDczMQ.jpg" >

    <p> I have an Associate Degree in Business Technologies and a Bachelors Degree in Business Management. I currently work at a Head Start Program. I love technology and always dive into the current innovations whenever possible.</p>


 <h2>My Background</h2>

<p>I do not have any background in coding. I actually just stumbled upon it based on a post i saw on a social media site. I became interested to learn more about it and began looking and learning about different bootcamps. I came across Codercamps and liked their mission.</p>

  <h2>Why I decided to learn programming?</h2>

  <p>In my research of programming I became intrigued by the endless abilities that a programmer the freedom of expression. I found myself spending countless hours in front of my computer trying to teach myself code. I knew it was something I wanted.  I know it is not easy and there will always be obstacles but part of cracking the code is determination, passion and the want and drive to do something and see it through.</p>
